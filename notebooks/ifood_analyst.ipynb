    "\n",
    "- Evaluate **customer response** to different promotional strategies  \n",
    "- Compare campaign performance through **controlled (A/B) tests**  \n",
    "- Define criteria for **evidence-based decision making**  \n",
    "- Support campaign planning with a focus on **impact and return on investment**\n",
    "\n",

    "- Definition of metrics, hypotheses, and decision criteria  \n",
    "- Interpretation of results with a focus on **business implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
