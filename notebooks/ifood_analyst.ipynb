    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes the **effectiveness of promotional campaigns in a premium retail context at iFood**, using an **adapted dataset** for analytical purposes. The scenario involves multiple campaigns with distinct strategies and a rich dataset containing **demographic, behavioral, and consumption** information.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate **customer response** to different promotional strategies  \n",
    "- Compare campaign performance through **controlled (A/B) tests**  \n",
    "- Define criteria for **evidence-based decision making**  \n",
    "- Support campaign planning with a focus on **impact and return on investment**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Approach\n",

    "\n",
    "- Exploration and preparation of customer data  \n",
    "- Analysis of customer profiles, purchasing behavior, and campaign history  \n",
    "- Comparison of test groups and performance evaluation across approaches  \n",
    "- Definition of metrics, hypotheses, and decision criteria  \n",
    "- Interpretation of results with a focus on **business implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes variables such as **income, household composition, recency, spending by category, purchase channels, website visits, campaign acceptance history**, as well as demographic and customer relationship attributes. It also includes the identification of **test groups** for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **clear and reproducible framework** for evaluating campaigns with analytical rigor and turning data into **actionable recommendations**, supporting marketing decisions focused on **performance, risk, and investment efficiency**.\n",
