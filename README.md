# 🍽️ iFood — Statistical Evaluation of Marketing Campaign Performance

## 📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using a structured statistical framework.

Instead of relying solely on observed conversion differences, the analysis applies formal statistical inference to determine whether performance differences are statistically meaningful or simply due to random variation.

The case simulates a real-world business scenario in which iFood must decide between two campaigns (Campaign 3 and Campaign 4) based on evidence-driven analysis.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Are Campaign 3 and Campaign 4 truly different in performance, or is the observed difference in conversion rates explained by sampling noise?

The objective is to reduce decision risk and ensure marketing investment is guided by statistical evidence rather than superficial metrics.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Framework

The project follows a rigorous progression:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Sample size estimation (finite population correction)
3. Confidence interval construction
4. Population validation
5. Two-proportion Z-test
6. Z-statistic computation
7. P-value interpretation
8. Formal hypothesis testing decision
9. Business recommendation

## 📊 Statistical Methodology

- Confidence intervals for conversion rate estimation
- Finite population correction
- Two-proportion Z-test
- P-value analysis
- Hypothesis testing at 5% significance level

---

## 📈 Key Result

The difference between Campaign 3 and Campaign 4 conversion rates was not statistically significant.

Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis:

> There is no statistical evidence that one campaign outperforms the other in terms of conversion rate.

---

## 💼 Strategic Recommendation

Since conversion performance is statistically equivalent, campaign selection should be based on financial metrics such as:

- Revenue per converted customer
- Contribution margin
- Campaign cost
- ROI
- Customer lifetime value impact
